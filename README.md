# üåç Emissions Analysis using 2015 Summary Commodity Dataset (IBM Internship Project)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the **"Supply Chain Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities - 2015 Summary Commodity"** dataset provided as part of the IBM Edunet AI/ML Green Skills Internship Program.

## üß† Project Objective

To understand and visualize the trends and relationships in IBM Shell's stock performance by:
- Analyzing key metrics (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)
- Identifying seasonal trends
- Exploring correlations
- Creating insightful visualizations

## üì¶ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: IBM/EDUNET-provided CSV dataset
- **Year Covered**: 2015
- **Scope**: Emissions data for U.S. industries and commodities across various greenhouse gases.
- **Total Rows**: 264
- **Columns**:
  - `Commodity Name`: Name of the commodity
  - `Substance`: Greenhouse gas emitted (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.)
  - `Unit`: Emission unit (kg, g, etc.)
  - `Supply Chain Emission Factors` (with/without margins): Core values showing emissions
  - Data Quality (DQ) metrics like:
    - `DQ ReliabilityScore`
    - `DQ TemporalCorrelation`
    - `DQ GeographicalCorrelation`
    - `DQ TechnologicalCorrelation`

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA was performed using **Python**, leveraging **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

### üîç 1. Initial Checks & Cleaning
- Viewed data shape, columns, types, basic stats
- Checked for:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicate rows
  - Unnecessary columns (e.g., dropped `Unnamed: 7`)

---

### üìâ 2. Visualizations & Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Bar Plot:
- **Substance-wise emission comparison**
- Helps identify which greenhouse gases dominate emissions

#### ‚úÖ Histogram:
- Distribution of the `Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins`
- Plots frequency & density (KDE)

#### ‚úÖ Pie Chart:
- Proportion of emissions by **Substance**
- Shows which gas contributes most to overall emissions

#### ‚úÖ Boxplot:
- Outlier detection in emission factors
- Visualizes spread and distribution

#### ‚úÖ Correlation Heatmap:
- Matrix of correlation among numerical fields (like DQ scores and emission values)
- Useful for feature relationships or redundancy checks

#### ‚úÖ Top Emitters (Bar Chart):
- Top 10 commodities or substances contributing the most emissions

#### ‚úÖ Commodity-Wise Analysis:
- Groups emission values by `Commodity Name`
- Visualizes top 10 most polluting commodities
